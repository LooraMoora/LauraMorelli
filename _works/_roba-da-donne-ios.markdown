Roba Da Donne

Roba da Donne is the biggest female community of Facebook in Italy. In April 2012, after the 900.000 fan, we collect feedback and needs of our community and start to design the best magazine for them.
Roba da Donne Magazine was born to satisfy their desires. It's a responsive website organized in two macro feature:
- a multi-category blog to provide always interesting contents;
- a multi-category forum;
- an e-commerce to sell merchandize;
- \+ an app iOS to a better experience in reading.

I was in charge to develop the front end
