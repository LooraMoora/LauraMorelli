## Product ##
#### concept  -  purpose ####

Gem wants to help people to be more councious about their happiness. Happiness is not buying a new stuff, is not reaching a new goal. Happiness is a status: you have no to reach it, you have to be councious about it.
How? Celebrating small big good things that happen to you every single day.

From this idea [Gem](http://www.gem-app.com) was born: an iOS app that help you to save and keep precious moments of your life.

## Brand ##
#### logo  -   style ####

The name Gem doesn't arrive in a couple of seconds. At the beginning I was thinking to the content of the app: because you write 3 good things everyday, ThreeThings seems the best choice for me.

But I soon got unhappy about this anonymus choice composed by abstracted names. So I move away from the content and I start to think about the mood and the style.
The thoughts I made about this product was how I can interpret this good things? Modi di Common saying has a deep teaching. The most linked one is "Money don't make you happy". From this, I use richness as primary parallelism in the app. The concept should be related to something richness, precious, etern, something you need to dig to obtain... Gem.

## UI ##
#### styleguide  -  assets ####

To dig in your mind and write your good things every single day is not an easy task. You need an amount of effort that depends on how much intensity and time pass from the good thing. Because of this required effort, a too elegant and luxurious style would make it too much serious.
So I made it playful.

## UX ##
#### prototypes  -  usability test  -  survey  -  tracking ####

As soon as the first build was ready, we was able to show our product to our friends. We showed it to our colleagues and friends separately. We also sent a beta invitation via Testflight in different places of the world: SF, Hamburg, Dublin. We collected feedbacks and we was we able to see and define what worked and what didn't. After that we sent a survey to collect impressions and favourites.

We release the app with different tracking events that let us to monitoring statistics and measure the conversion of the onboarding and of gem insert funnels.

## People ##
#### agile  -  collaboration ####

From the idea to the app. Never able to build it in my own.
Thanks to a very competent developer who is enthusiastic about the idea.
We planning our a week sprint, using Trello as board, Slack to communicate and Zeplin to share design blueprints.

After 4 months of passionate work, Gem was released.
