Happiness is not buying a new stuff, is not reaching a new goal. Happiness is a status: you have no to reach it, you have to be councious about it.
How? Celebrating small big good things that happen to you every single day.

From this idea [Gem](http://www.gem-app.com) was born: an iOS app that help you to save and keep precious moments of your life.

Brand concept
------------
The name Gem doesn't arrive in a couple of seconds. At the beginning I was thinking to the content of the app: because you write 3 good things everyday, ThreeThings seems the best choice for me.

But I soon got unhappy about this anonymus choice composed by abstracted names. So **I move away from the content and I start to think about the mood and the style**.
The thoughts I made about this product was how I can interpret this good things? Modi di Common saying has a deep teaching. The most linked one is "Money don't make you happy". From this, I use richness as primary parallelism in the app. The concept should be related to something richness, precious, etern, something you need to dig to obtain... Gem.

Brand style
------------
To dig in your mind and write your good things every single day is not a easy task. You need an amount of effort that depends on how much intensity and time pass. Because of the required effort, a too elegant and luxurious style would make it too much serious.
So I made it playful.

The develop
------------
From the idea to the app. Never able to build it in my own.
Thanks to a very competent developer who is enthusiastic about the idea.
We planning our a week sprint, using Trello as board, Slack to communicate and Zeplin to share design blueprints.
