## Product ##
#### business goals  -  user needs ####

Subito is a product that let you to sell and buy second hand stuffs. With 9mln of users that insert 150.000 ads every day, Subito is the most used marketplace in Italy.

With Subito I got in touch for the first time with a product that increase in business but that help people: improving Subito thinking that I'm improving people life is my motivation.

In the last period, one of my responsability in Subito is helping in the definition of the business goals: they should never be so far from the user needs.

## UX ##
#### desgin personas  -  journey map  -  scenarios  -  wireframe  -  flows  -  usability test  -  tracking ####

All the people in charge for a product are responsible of the UX: not everybody are sensible to this aspect, especially if you have never seen how a product is used by users, how design and development that define the product impact UX. To gather, to spread and to teach "who", "what", "when", "how" and especially "why" is one of my role.

To do it I use some tools:
+ design-personas to help development teams to focus on the goal to reach;
+ journey maps and scenarios to describe users dinamics onsite and offline too;
+ flows to show how UI should work;
+ usability test to highlight particular corner case and to collet qualitative data;
+ tracking plans to catch quantitative data that are analized after the release.

## UI ##
#### styleguide  -  prototypes  -  assets  -  coerence  -   consistency ####

After the middle 2015, Subito was lived the revolutioned: the rebranding. During the definition of the brandguide, as part of the team UX I contribute to define, realize and decline styleguides for of all the properties: website and mobile, Android and iOS apps.
Documentation and rules continue in order to let that every deisgner is able to mantain coerence and consistency in the whole service, from the product, to the comunication emails and so on.

In this phase I collaborate with developers too defining naming, tools, processes
In questa fase, oltre alla collaborazione con i designer, un enorme lavoro è stato affrontato con i developers: naming, tool, iterazioni continue sono state il punto di forza durante tutto il percorso.

## People ##
#### agile / scrum - design review ####

Last but don’t least people.
I start in Subito working in a only-iOS team. After a year and half we reorganized ourself to work better so my team became a cross platforms team. We always work with an Agile method.

I’m also direct line in UX team: our responsability is to project the best experience for our user. So in UX team we meet every week in a design review meeting.
In the last period I work stright with PM in order to define right guide about the product.
