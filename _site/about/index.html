  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I’m a Product Designer who think about the Person, human behaviours and emotions.
My purpose is understanding and driving experiences: I have a strong desire to find product problems and customer needs and to solve them with design.
Make life easier for huge user bases products is my persuasion.</p>

<p>Everything starts with right questions: from the answers I create sketchings on paper to identify as many solutions it’s needed to achieve goals. Avoiding not working sketch, I convert conveying ones in working prototypes, taking care about interactions, animations and flows.
I share prototype with designers, stakeholders and developers to collect feedback in order to refine the prototype and taking care about the details.</p>

<p>After that I iterate in Agile process with developers to give life to the prototype.
I have experience in UI design of iOS and Android native apps, following two different operating system patterns, and responsive web-application too.</p>

<p>I have a deep interest of psychology and recently I’m discovering and studing UX research methods.</p>
